Section 1:
    In this programming project, we have to take a length 5 string and break it up into 5 single digit integers, then output them.

Section 2:
    Lets say that we obtain the number 16384. We seperate the number into 5 subdivisions. We can place this into their own integer variable.
    Then we can print to screen each one seperated by a single space character.

Section 3:
    Given any number that is length 5, we will ask the user to input a number.
    Upon getting that number, we must verify the length of the number to ensure our calculations are processed.
    After checking the input, we will seperate the string into 5 different variables, one for each number.
    We will be doing this by using array calling through the string from input.
    Then we can print to screen each variable seperated by a space character.

Section 4:
    Variables:
        userInput - string
        First - char/int
        Second - char/int
        third - char/int
        fourth - char/int
        fifth - char/int

Section 5 & 6:
    Take input:
        Loop indefinitely until valid input:
        userInput = input("Please enter a 5 digit number[10000 -> 99999]: ")
        if(len(userInput) != 5):
            print("Invalid input")
        else:
            break;
    Output:
        first = userInput[0]; second = userInput[1]; third = userInput[2]; fourth = userInput[3]; fifth = userInput[4]
        print(first + ' ' + second + ' ' + third + ' ' + fourth + ' ' + fifth)
