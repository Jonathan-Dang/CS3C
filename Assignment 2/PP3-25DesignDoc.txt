Section 1:
    In this problem, there are two inputs:
    • The taxable income
    • The marital status
    There is one output:
    • The tax dependent on said income and martial status.

Section 2:
    Lets assume we have a married couple whose combined income is in between $64,000
    and $16,000. In the tax bracket, it is said that we have to start off with a base of 
    $1,600 and then add 15% of the total income as tax. If we have a single person making over 
    $32,000, then we would start with $4,400 then add 25% of their income.

Section 3:
    To calculate the tax, we would have to run the data through a bracket. Comparing the 
    data entered to set values. income < ##,### etc. This is also checked with if the person
    filing is married or not. Then calculating the tax is simply
    tax = (tax constant) + income * (Percentage bracket)

Section 4:
    •Income
    •Married
    •Tax

Section 5 & 6:
    if (married == 'y' or married == 'Y'):
    married = True
    else:
    married = False

    if(married):
    if(income > 64000):
        tax = 8800 + income*.25   
    elif(income < 64000 and income > 16000):
        tax = 1600 + income*.15
    elif(income <= 16000):
        tax = income*.1
    else:    
    if(income > 32000):
        tax = 4400 + income*.25   
    elif(income < 32000 and income > 8000):
        tax = 800 + income*.15
    elif(income <= 8000):
        tax = income*.1
