Section 1:
    In this problem, there is only 1 input in the form on a string taken from the user.
    This string can contain anything.
    The output are printed statements that display certain characteristics of the string.

Section 2:
    Let's assume that the string is "Hello". The program would then state that the string has
    only characters and starts with a capital letter. If the string was "HELLO", then along with
    the previous outputs, it would print all caps.

Section 3:
    First, given a string, we would have to check for each flag. The problem states the follow flags:
    •contains only letters.
	•contains only uppercase letters.
	•contains only lowercase letters.
	•contains only digits.
	•contains only letters and digits.
	•starts with an uppercase letter.
	•ends with a period.

    To determine the upper vs lower case letters in the string, we need to confirm that all the 
    characters are letters and not any other chars. Then we would traverse the entire string in order
    to verify either fully Upper and fully Lower. For starting with an uppercase and ending with a period,
    we only need to check the first and last characters of the string input. We do the same thing as we did 
    for the upper and lower for digits.

Section 4:
    •userInput

    -bool CheckAllCaps(string)
    -bool CheckAllLower(string)
    -bool CheckChars(string)
    -bool CheckDigit(string)

Section 5 & 6:
    while(True):
    userInput = input("Please input a string: ")
    if(CheckAllCaps(userInput)):
        print("Contains Only Capital letters")
    if(CheckAllLower(userInput)):
        print("Contains Only Lowercase letters")
    if(CheckChars(userInput)):
        print("Contains only Letters")
    if(CheckDigit(userInput)):
        print("Contains only Numbers")
    if(userInput[0].isupper()):
        print("First Letter is Uppercase")
    if(userInput[len(userInput) - 1] == '.'):
        print("Ends with a period!")
        
    sentinal = input("Repeat the process? y/n:")
    if(sentinal == 'n' or sentinal == 'N'):
        break;
