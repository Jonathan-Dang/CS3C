Input
    In detail, what are the inputs to this program?
        PP6-45
        -There is only one input for this program, the directory of the WAV file.
        PP6-42
        -There are two inputs for this program, both are directories to unique WAV files.
    How will you validate the input?
        PP6-45 AND PP6-42
        -The Scryp.io function will throw an exception and end the code due to an invalid file directory.
    Pseudocode: Briefly explain how this section will look.
        PP6-45 AND PP6-42
        Read a directory from console
        Then put it into scipy.io.wavfile.read method.
Processing
    What does this program calculate?
        PP6-45
        -The program will reverse the given WAV file. 
        PP6-42
        -The program will mix and average the two given WAV files. 
    Can you divide the calculations to the smaller “modules”?
        PP6-45 AND PP6-42
        -Yes, I divided the actual modification process from the main file. Otherwise, all the processes are simple and 
        direct.
    Pseudocode: Briefly explain how this(these) section(s) will look. 
        PP6-45
        -First, obtain data from the WAV file, then replicate the data and then reverse the list.
            Create a new file and add the "-reverseValue" tag.
        PP6-42
        -First, obtain the data from the WAV files, then add both value for each sample together, averaging them.
            Create a new file and add the "Mixed" tag.
Output
    What will this program display?
        PP6-45
        -The output would be a WAV file with the -reverseValue tag.
        PP6-42
        -The output would be a WAV file with the Mixed tag.
    How will the output be formatted?
        PP6-45
        -"{FILENAME}-reverseValue.wav"
        PP6-42
        -"{FILENAME}Mixed.wav"
    Pseudocode: Briefly explain how this section will look.
        PP6-45 AND PP6-42
        -Call the write function from the wavfile library, then put in the data, sample rate, and filename.
Variables
    What variables will this program require?
        PP6-45 AND PP6-42
        -I would need the filename, sample rate, and raw data.
    How will you create variable names that are descriptive and conventionally styled?
        PP6-45 AND PP6-42
        -I will use a minimilistic style which would retain meaning in a more direct fasion.
    Are there constant variables? How will you name them?
        PP6-45 AND PP6-42
        -There are no constant variables.
    Which variables need to be reset if the user wants to repeat the program?
        PP6-45 AND PP6-42
        -The only variable that needs to be reset would be the file directory.
