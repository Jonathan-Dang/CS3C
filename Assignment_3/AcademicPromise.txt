This assignment was created and written with my own work (Or additionally with the help of this week's partner)
and I(we) promise that we held academic integrity at all times during this assignment.
If I(we) have been inclined to create something based of off another's work, I(we) will include 
specific details pertaining to the assignment within the .py file of each project.
I(we) did not seek outside assistance that would violate academic integrity at any point in time, before and to the future
of this class.
